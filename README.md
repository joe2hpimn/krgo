## TODO

* smart way to get image id
* performance: add some concurrency
* usage demonstration (nsinit, lxc)
* tests (closely related to some docker package, need a way to find out quickly if a new docker version breaks things up)
* vendor dependencies

## Warning

* Untaring on the vagrant shared folder will fail
* cgroup-lite must be installed
